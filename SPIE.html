<p>SOCIAL: Our civilization’s social structure is used for identification, showing people where they lie in society. It is also used to create the basis of a nonchaotic system. Our social structure is organized with religious leaders, the primary rulers over all at the top. Following religious leaders comes the scribes, soldiers, merchants, farmers, and slaves. Each group on the social pyramid plays a vital role in our civilization. With religious leaders being at the top of the social structure, they enforce laws of religion, heavily. Our religion, Bahdahbok is the leading rule in our society, while Bahdahbok has it own holiday named after itself. Fear through religion provides order and harmony and is also used to prevent a revolution. Fear through religion is possible because of the three Gods in our polytheistic society. Our gods represent many things, but definitely not violence or revolt, so if citizens did otherwise, than ostracism would be inflicted. Ostracism was an effective punishment for those who broke the law, while there were only a few primary laws. These primary laws included no murder which results in punishment from the Gods and no questioning of Bahdahbok which results in ostracism and higher taxes. If refusal to pay taxes occurred then no public works could be done, which would lead farmers to have no goods to trade and you would be put into slavery until debts could be payed off. 
	The center of our civilization is the Temple of Badah.  In this temple, religious leaders live and people from all over the civilization come to pray.  The temple is the center of the entire civilization because the civilization is a theocracy, so the religious leaders run the whole civilization and govern it using the words of the Book of Badah.  Beside the temple of Badah is the Coliseum of Badah, which serves as entertainment for the poor and a monument for the entire civilization; a structure that is the face of the society and is visited by peoples from many neighboring civilizations.  This monument is extremely significant because it takes the poor people’s thoughts off of the fact that they can barely afford food. </p>

<p> POLITICAL: Our government system is a theocracy. Power is distributed under the rule of religious leaders who enforce power under the rule of the Book of Bahdahbok, with this book being written and established, religion and politics were inseparable. Politics were used to put citizens in order. You could be a citizen if you followed Bahdahbok and served in the military for 3 years. Some rights and responsibilities of the citizens included voting, although citizens were not allowed to have them. </p>
